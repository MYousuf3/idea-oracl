    "proposal": "1. Title: Fair Evaluation of Large Language Models\n\n2. Problem Statement: The evaluation of large language models (LLMs) is a critical task, but the current evaluation paradigm using LLMs as evaluators is flawed due to a systematic bias, where the order of candidate responses can significantly influence the evaluation results. This bias can lead to inaccurate and unfair comparisons between models, compromising the reliability of LLMs as evaluators.\n\n3. Motivation: Existing methods for evaluating LLMs, such as n-gram metrics and model-based evaluations, are insufficient for assessing the alignment of generated responses with human intent. Human evaluation is the most accurate measure, but it is costly and time-consuming. The use of LLMs as evaluators has gained popularity, but their reliability is uncertain due to their sensitivity to textual instructions and inputs. The positional bias in LLM evaluators raises concerns about the fairness and accuracy of model comparisons.\n\n4. Proposed Method: We propose two simple yet effective strategies to mitigate the positional bias in LLM evaluators: Multiple Evidence Calibration (MEC) and Balanced Position Calibration (BPC). MEC requires the evaluator model to generate multiple detailed pieces of evidence before assigning ratings, leveraging the inherent properties of causal language models for calibration.

Leveraging this observation, we then define a new curvature-based criterion for judging if a passage is generated from a given LLM. This approach, which we call , does not require training a separate classifier, collecting a dataset of real or generated passages, or explicitly watermarking generated text.

However, existing methods for zero-shot detection have limitations, and there is a need for a more effective and generalizable approach.\n\n3.

In contrast, our proposed method, , leverages the local curvature of the log probability function to detect model-generated text, which is a more nuanced and informative signal.\n\n4. Proposed Method: Our method, , uses a perturbation function to generate semantically similar rephrasings of the original passage and estimates the local curvature of the log probability function by approximating the trace of the Hessian of the model's log probability function.

    "abstract": "Ever since the Turing Test was proposed in the 1950s, humans have explored the mastering of language intelligence by machine. Language is essentially a complex, intricate system of human expressions governed by grammatical rules. It poses a significant challenge to develop capable artificial intelligence~(AI) algorithms for comprehending and grasping a language. As a major approach, language modeling has been widely studied for language understanding and generation in the past two decades, evolving from statistical language models to neural language models. Recently, pre-trained language models~(PLMs) have been proposed by pre-training Transformer models over large-scale corpora, showing strong capabilities in solving various natural language processing~(NLP) tasks. Since the researchers have found that model scaling can lead to an improved model capacity, they further investigate the scaling effect by increasing the parameter scale to an even larger size. Interestingly, when the parameter scale exceeds a certain level, these enlarged language models not only achieve a significant performance improvement, but also exhibit some special abilities ( in-context learning) that are not present in small-scale language models ( BERT). To discriminate the language models in different parameter scales, the research community has coined the term large language models~(LLM) for the PLMs of significant size ( containing tens or hundreds of billions of parameters). Recently, the research on LLMs has been largely advanced by both academia and industry, and a remarkable progress is the launch of ChatGPT (a powerful AI chatbot developed based on LLMs), which has attracted widespread attention from society. The technical evolution of LLMs has been making an important impact on the entire AI community, which would revolutionize the way how we develop and use AI algorithms. Considering this rapid technical progress, in this survey, we review the recent advances of LLMs by introducing the background, key findings, and mainstream techniques. In particular, we focus on four major aspects of LLMs, namely pre-training, adaptation tuning, utilization, and capacity evaluation. Furthermore, we also summarize the available resources for developing LLMs and discuss the remaining issues for future directions. This survey provides an up-to-date review of the literature on LLMs, which can be a useful resource for both researchers and engineers.",
